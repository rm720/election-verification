\chapter*{Abstract}
Elections are a crucial part of democracy. However, traditional paper-based voting systems are laborious and lack transparency. Electronic elections promise improvement through automation, but also present challenges due to the error-prone nature of software. These complexities amplify with the integration of cryptography, potentially leading to additional errors. Even minor errors can have significant consequences, such as the wrong candidate winning an election.

In response to these challenges, we advocate for error-free electronic elections. As a solution, we propose the development of an election verifier program, a tool designed to verify the integrity of electronic elections. This work presents an improved technique to develop such a verifier, leading to better trustworthiness of electronic elections.
