\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Thomas Haines for his support and advice during this project. I am extremely grateful to Michael Norrish, who generously spent time with me explaining the specifics of HOL and CakeML during numerous live coding sessions. Special thanks to Hing-Lun (Joseph) Chan, who developed the Abstract Algebra Library, which our project extensively relies on. Many thanks to the whole Co-Lab team, especially to Jan Shaddock and ANU for facilitating the whole process and providing such a great research experience. I would also like to thank everyone on the CakeML contributors Slack channel for their helpful insights and support.
